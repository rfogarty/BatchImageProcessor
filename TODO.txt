Design strategy
===============

* Image types are all based on abstract template types. So none of the images actually have
 a defined type until the very last minute.
* The hope is that algorithms can also operate as generically as possible, and thus work on
 abstract types.

* For converting between image types, there are really 3 things to consider:
   1) Channel bitdepth or resolution
   2) Color, grayscale, or other format (HSI/HSL/HSV, CMYK, etc.)
   3) Actual image format, which is really a separate issue and should be resolved in the writing functions

* Should have conversion functions between pixel types.
* Move MAX and MIN values into the Pixel types, to ensure algorithms can be made generic.
** Perhaps even a simple min and max function can be supplied.
* Smoothing function needs to be done.
* Add scaling function back in - maybe look at doing FFT-based solution for arbitrary scaling.
