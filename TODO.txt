Future TODOs
===============
DONE * Should have conversion functions between image and pixel types.
** For converting between image types, there are really 3 things to consider:
   1) Channel bitdepth or resolution
   2) Color, grayscale, or other format (HSI/HSL/HSV, CMYK, etc.)
   3) Actual image format, which is really a separate issue and should be resolved in the writing functions
DONE * Test with AddressSanitizer to ensure absolutely no bad memory accesses
DONE * Test with Valgrind to ensure no memory leaks or bad array indexing - see results below.

HW#2

1. Histogram modification [5 points]

DONE  * Add histogram stretching for grey level images to your choice of options
DONE  * Stretching is defined by user provided intensity range parameters (a, b): stretch the intensities in the range between
     a and b on the input image to the range of 0 to 255 as output. [0,a] -> 0, [a,b] -> [0,255], [b,255] -> 255
DONE    ** Your program should apply the procedure within ROI (up to three ROI as Hw1)
DONE    ** Generate image of the histograms for the ROI before and after the procedure, this is good for debugging
       and illustrations
  * Test your program on some grey level images.

2.Color Processing [5 points]

  * operate within specified ROIs (up to three ROIs)
DONE  * Apply the histogram stretching to R,G,B components independently, then combine in one color image,
    experiment and discuss results
DONE  * Implement RGB to HSI conversion
  * Apply intensity histogram stretching by applying it to the I-component, display I as grey level image, then
    convert back to RGB for display. Compare utilization of RGB vs HSI for histogram stretching.
  * [extra credit - 1 point] Perform histogram stretching on both I and S components. How about including all three
    I, S and H components? Experiment.

3. Make sure that you have complete report for this assignment (not just few comments).

  * Include input and output images (use several gray level images).
  * Discuss performance of histogram processing on grey level and color images



HW#1

1. General modification
DONE   a. You are to add all new processing to the image manipulation program provided by TA.
DONE   b. Alternatively, you can implement the above by yourself
DONE   c. Modify updated access to parameter file containing list of images, specification of the function to perform 
      on each image, and set of parameters for each image. [1 point]

2. Processing of Grey Level Images
DONE   a. Implement rectangular region of interest (ROI) selection by specifying pixel location (X,Y) of the left-top pixel
      of ROI and ROI size (Sx,Sy). Each of the following operations should be performed in ROI and combined
      image generated. Allow at least three ROIs per image. [1 points]
DONE   b. Modify all HW0 functions (except scaling) to operate only within specified ROIs. Allow different parameters
      for each ROI. [1 points]
DONE   c. Implement uniform smoothing filter operation using square odd window size (WS). Implement adaptive
      processing when smoothing window is close to the ROI boundary by progressively reducing window size all
      the way to 3x3 [3 points]

3. Processing of Color Images
DONE   a. Add color brightness modification to your toolbox. Let value Add-C be user defined threshold. Process each
      color channel: R1=R+Add-C, G1=G+Add-C, B1=B+Add-C. Make sure (R1,G1,B1) are within allowable
      values. This function should operate within specified ROI with different parameters for each ROI. [1 points]
DONE   b. Add color binarization option to your image processing toolbox. Let threshold TC be user defined input
      parameter. For color images, consider TC be a distance from user defined color C(CR,CB,CG) in RGB space.
      Set all pixels within TC distance to "red" and the rest to "white". This function should operate within specified
      ROI with different parameters for each ROI. [3 points]

4. Write the report for this assignment
DONE   a. Create a "readme" file specifying format of the parameter file, describe all parameters and all run options (include
      in the report).
DONE   b. Give an example of the parameter file set to process with several images with varying functions and parameters.
DONE   c. Describe all operations and your implementation.
DONE   d. Do include input and output example images for each function implemented (use several gray level and color images
      and at least two different parameters as appropriate, multiple ROIs, etc.)
DONE   e. Utilize your cell phone or web cam to capture sample images suitable for testing your software
      discuss results and performance of all operation
